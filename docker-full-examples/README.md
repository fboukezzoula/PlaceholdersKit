# A Full example illustrating the use of PlaceholdersKit tool ! 

We will use the Microsoft's template MVC dotnet application for this full example of using the PlaceholdersKit tool. It's a frontend application. We will update the homepage of the web site for adding several sentences **with placeholders**. The delimiters of these placeholders are **{{...}}**. Then we will deploy the dotnet application (as a stack application Docker) in INTEGRATION-DEV environment by using all the Key Names taken in an external KV Consul Store, from the INTEGRATION-DEV endpoint.
